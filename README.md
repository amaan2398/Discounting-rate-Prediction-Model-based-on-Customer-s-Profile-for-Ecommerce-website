# Discounting-rate-Prediction-Model-based-on-Customer-s-Profile-for-Ecommerce-website
Every customer wants the best price, on the other hand, every retailer wants the best margin with customer satisfaction and an increase in the count of a loyal customer. For that retailer try to identify the loyalty of the customer and offer a special discount to them. In the current situation, there is a lack of identifying loyal customers, measuring their loyalty and offering personalized offers on an online ecommerce platform.    In this project, the main aim is to build a machine learning model which can predict discount for ecommerce websites based on customer loyalty.
